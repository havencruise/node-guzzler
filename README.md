## Default instructions to setup a node.js project.

	1.	Setup a virtual-env as your python environment - 
		"bin/create_environment.py" which will also install 'nodeenv'.
		The environment will be installed in env/

	2.	Activate your python environment "source env/bin/activate", 
		and run "nodeenv -p" which will install the latest version 
		of Node.js in conjunction to your virtual-env

Note: DO NOT CHECK IN YOUR "env/" directory
